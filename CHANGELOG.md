# Changelog

All notable changes to Autopilotagent will be documented in this file.

## 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- **Task file schema enforcement** - Added explicit field-name mapping table and validation checklist to `commands/tasks.md` to prevent agents from generating non-conforming JSON (e.g. `tasks` instead of `requirements`, `title` instead of `description`, missing `tdd` structure). Agents like CommandCode that don't follow the example JSON closely will now see a clear "CRITICAL: Exact Schema Required" section with wrong-name warnings.

## 2026-06-02

### Added
- **Multi-agent wrapper support** - `run.sh` now supports `--agent claude|codex|opencode|cmd` and `AUTOPILOTAGENT_AGENT`, allowing the same task loop to launch Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, or Command Code sessions. Claude keeps the existing slash-command path; other agents run headless with prompts that point at the shared Autopilotagent command specs.
- **Shared agent installation targets** - `install.sh` now links `AGENTS.md`, command specs, and the Autopilotagent Agent Skill into Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and Command Code config locations while preserving the existing Claude slash-command and hook install.
- **Autopilotagent Agent Skill** - Added `skills/autopilotagent/SKILL.md` so supported agents can discover the Autopilotagent workflow as a reusable Agent Skill.
- **Install test coverage** - Added `tests/install-tests.sh` to verify installer behavior using an isolated `HOME`.
- **Executable agent loop tests** - Added fake CLI coverage for non-interactive launch arguments, task progress, invalid-test progress, stop handling, and cleanup detection.

### Fixed
- **Stale no-argument test expectation** - Updated the shell test to match the current `run.sh` error message for missing task or command input.
- **Codex automation syntax** - Switched Codex dry-run and execution commands from deprecated `--full-auto` to explicit `--sandbox workspace-write`.
- **Agent exit codes and cleanup** - Preserved non-zero agent exit codes after `wait` and replaced machine-specific stale-process cleanup patterns with token-based matching for Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and Command Code.
- **OpenCode automation syntax** - Switched OpenCode execution from legacy prompt mode to current `opencode run --dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- **OpenCode permission compatibility** - Added `AUTOPILOTAGENT_OPENCODE_PERMISSION_FLAG` so older or differently configured OpenCode installs can override or disable the default permission bypass flag.
- **Batch progress for invalid tests** - Count `invalidTest: true` as batch progress while monitoring a running agent session and report invalid-test progress in the session summary.
- **Model forwarding** - Forward `--model` to Codex, OpenCode, and Command Code runners when supplied.

## 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Feature branch per run** - TDD task mode now automatically creates (or checks out) a branch named after the feature before starting work. Branch name is derived from the task file basename (e.g. `my-feature.json` → branch `my-feature`).

---

## 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Parallel agent support (Phase 1)** - Multiple `run.sh` instances can now run simultaneously on different task files. Per-feature state files (PID, loop-state, stop-signal) are stored in the feature's directory (`docs/autopilotagent/<feature>/`) instead of the shared `.autopilotagent/` root. `run.sh` exports `AUTOPILOTAGENT_STATE_DIR` so the stop-hook finds the correct loop-state file per instance.
- **`hooks/git-commit` commit mutex** - New wrapper around `git commit` that serializes commits via `mkdir` lock (POSIX atomic). Prevents staging-area races when parallel agents commit simultaneously.
- **Parallel awareness in `autopilotagent.md`** - Phase 0c instructs agents to check for sibling `run.pid` files and follow safe git practices (specific file adds, serialized commits via `hooks/git-commit`) when running in parallel.

### Changed
- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Added superpowers skill output conventions: plans save to `docs/plans/` (not `docs/superpowers/plans/`).

---

## 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **PRD option recommendations** - When asking clarifying questions with lettered options, the agent now recommends which option it thinks is best and explains why. Users can still pick any option.

### Fixed
- **Git tag conflicts** - Autopilotagent failed when resuming incomplete requirements because `git tag autopilotagent/req-ID/start` errors on existing tags. Changed instruction to use `git tag -f` which overwrites stale tags from prior attempts. Affects resumed runs, post-rollback retries, and un-stuck requirements.

---

## 2026-03-11

### Changed
- **PRD one-at-a-time questions** - Clarifying questions are now asked one per message in a conversational flow instead of dumped all at once. Announces question count upfront, shows progress (e.g., "Question 3 of ~12"), and acknowledges each answer briefly before moving on.

---

## 2026-03-08

### Changed
- **PRD clarifying questions** - Changed from "ask 3-5 critical questions" to "ask as many as a professional PM/senior dev would ask a client." Added follow-up question rounds, expanded guidelines with 14 areas to probe (users, flows, edge cases, data, permissions, integrations, performance, etc.). PRDs no longer have an "Open Questions" section — all questions must be resolved before writing.
- **File paths restructured** - All generated files now live in `docs/autopilotagent/<feature-name>/` instead of `docs/tasks/prds/`. Analytics go in `docs/autopilotagent/<feature-name>/analytics/`. Standalone mode notes (tests, lint, entropy) go in `docs/autopilotagent/<mode>/YYYY-MM-DD-notes.md`. Updated `prd.md`, `tasks.md`, `autopilotagent.md`, `analyze.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `autopilotagent.schema.json`, `run.sh`, `install.sh`, `README.md`, and example files.
- **Analytics directory derivation** - `run.sh` now derives the analytics directory from the task file path instead of reading a global config value.

---

## 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- **Analytics population** - Analytics files were always empty (`actualIterations: 0`, `requirements: []`, `summary: null`) because population was a prompt instruction that the LLM ignored. Analytics are now populated by infrastructure: `update-analytics.sh` reads task JSON, git tags, and commit history to derive requirement statuses, iteration counts, files written, and summary statistics. The LLM prompt is reduced to error logging only.
- **Stop-hook prompt extraction** - The `sed`-based YAML frontmatter extraction (`sed '1,/^---$/d' | sed '1,/^---$/d'`) never worked: the first `sed` consumed both `---` delimiters, leaving the second `sed` with no delimiter to find, so it deleted everything. Replaced with `awk '/^---$/{n++; next} n>=2'` which correctly counts delimiters. This fixes within-session looping — previously the hook always allowed exit on first stop, forcing all iteration to happen via run.sh session restarts.

### Added
- **`hooks/update-analytics.sh`** - Shell script that populates analytics from ground truth. Called by both `run.sh` (after each session) and `stop-hook.sh` (on completion/max-iterations). Derives requirement status from task JSON flags, `startedAt` from git tags, `iterations` from commit counts, `filesWritten` from git diff. Preserves LLM-written `errors[]` data.
- **`actualIterations` tracking in stop-hook** - The hook now increments `actualIterations` in the analytics file on each loop iteration, and writes `analytics_file`/`task_file` paths from loop-state frontmatter.
- **Analytics discovery in run.sh** - After each session, `run.sh` finds the matching analytics file by task name stem and calls `update-analytics.sh` to populate it.

### Changed
- **`analytics.schema.json`** - `toolCalls`, `phases`, and `filesRead` now accept `null` with descriptions noting they are optional LLM-dependent fields that infrastructure does not track.
- **`autopilotagent.md` ANALYTICS_INSTRUCTION** - Reduced from full analytics tracking to error logging only. Infrastructure handles iteration counting, requirement status, file tracking, and summary generation.
- **`autopilotagent.md` loop-state template** - Now includes `analytics_file:` and `task_file:` in YAML frontmatter so the stop-hook can access them.

---

## 2026-02-13

### Changed
- **run.sh permissions** - Replaced `--dangerously-skip-permissions` with `--allowedTools` to pre-approve tools individually. This avoids the interactive bypass permissions confirmation prompt that Claude Code now shows on every session, while keeping manual Claude Code sessions fully permissioned. A one-time workspace trust prompt appears the first time `autopilotagent` runs in a new project directory.

---

## 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- **Orphaned process cleanup** - `run.sh` now kills the entire process tree (MCP servers, subagents, bun workers) when terminating Claude sessions, not just the main process. Previously, child processes would reparent to init and accumulate indefinitely, consuming memory until the system killed new sessions.

### Added
- **`kill_session()` helper** - Collects all descendant PIDs before sending SIGTERM, then force-kills survivors after 5 seconds. Prevents orphaned processes from accumulating across autopilotagent runs.
- **EXIT trap cleanup** - `run.sh` now cleans up the active Claude session on any exit (normal, Ctrl+C, SIGTERM), ensuring no child processes are left behind.
- **`--cleanup` flag** - `run.sh --cleanup` kills stale background Claude/MCP processes before starting a new run. Useful after ungraceful terminations.
- **`cleanup.sh`** - Standalone script to find and kill orphaned Claude Code processes. Supports `--dry-run` to preview and `--all` to include terminal-attached sessions. Installed as `autopilotagent-cleanup` CLI command.
- **SIGINT/SIGTERM handling** - `run.sh` now traps Ctrl+C and SIGTERM for graceful shutdown with full process tree cleanup, instead of leaving orphans.

---

## 2026-01-24

### Changed
- **Renamed `/init` to `/autopilotagent init`** - The init command is now namespaced under `/autopilotagent init` to avoid conflicting with Claude Code's native `/init` command (which creates CLAUDE.md files)
  - File renamed from `commands/init.md` to `commands/autopilotagent:init.md`
  - Symlink updated accordingly
  - Re-run `./install.sh` to update your symlinks

---

## 2026-01-18

### Added
- **Command loop mode** - Run any slash command repeatedly with fresh sessions
  - Usage: `autopilotagent /my-command --max 5` or `/autopilotagent /my-command --max 5`
  - Runs the command N times, starting a fresh Claude session each iteration
  - Useful for repetitive tasks, batch processing, or running review commands multiple times
  - Default iterations configurable via `iterations.command` in autopilotagent.json (default: 10)
- **`--max N` flag** for run.sh command mode to specify iteration count
- **`iterations.command`** configuration in autopilotagent.json schema and template

### Changed
- **run.sh** now supports two modes: task file mode (existing) and command loop mode (new)
- **Argument parsing** for command mode uses explicit `--max N` to avoid ambiguity with command arguments

---

## 2026-01-15

### Added
- **Model selection** - `run.sh` now supports `--model` flag to choose Claude model (opus, sonnet, haiku, or full model name)
  - Example: `autopilotagent tasks.json --model sonnet` for faster, cheaper runs
  - Example: `autopilotagent tasks.json --model haiku --batch 5` for maximum speed
- **Debug logging** - Stop-hook includes DEBUG statements for troubleshooting completion detection
- **Sentinel stop file** - Autopilotagent writes `.autopilotagent/stop-signal` when all requirements complete, signaling `run.sh` to exit
- **Active session monitoring** - `run.sh` now runs Claude in background and actively monitors for completion
  - Checks task JSON every 2 seconds for progress
  - Detects batch completion and terminates for fresh context
  - Idle detection: restarts after 30s idle if progress was made (prevents stale context)
  - Timeout detection: terminates after 10 minutes with no progress (prevents stuck sessions)
- **Test fixtures** - Added `tests/fixtures/` with minimal autopilotagent.json and tasks-simple.json for development testing

### Fixed
- **Loop termination** - Stop-hook now sends SIGTERM to parent Claude process when complete, ensuring Claude actually exits (previously just returned "allow" which didn't force termination)
- **Batch completion detection** - `run.sh` now monitors task JSON for progress and terminates Claude when batch size is reached, avoiding context window exhaustion

---

## 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Quick Start guide** - New 5-minute getting started section with decision tree for choosing execution method
- **Expanded troubleshooting** - 15+ common issues with detailed solutions (was 4 items)
- **Monorepo examples** - `examples/autopilotagent-monorepo.json` and `examples/tasks-monorepo.json`
- **Mode: Metrics** - New command `/autopilotagent metrics` (alias for analyze with aggregation focus)
- **Dependency validation** - `run.sh` now checks for `jq` and `claude` CLI before running
- **JSON validation** - `run.sh` validates task file is valid JSON with requirements array
- **Progress visibility** - `run.sh` shows completed/stuck counts after each session

### Fixed
- **Iterations mismatch** - `init.md` now uses correct defaults (15/10/15/10) matching template and docs

### Improved
- **Error messages** - Configuration errors now include actionable fix instructions
- **Task file errors** - Better messages with common locations and how to generate

---

## 2026-01-13 (earlier)

### Added
- **Built-in loop mechanism** - Autopilotagent now includes its own stop-hook, eliminating the dependency on the external ralph-loop plugin
  - `hooks/stop-hook.sh` - Intercepts exit attempts, re-feeds prompts for iteration
  - `hooks/hooks.json` - Hook configuration template
  - State stored in `.autopilotagent/loop-state.md` with YAML frontmatter
- **`/autopilotagent cancel` command** - Cancel an active hook-based loop by removing the state file
  - Different from `/autopilotagent stop` which signals the run.sh wrapper
  - Graceful cancellation - current work completes before loop exits
- **Improved stop-hook features** (based on ralph-loop):
  - Reads transcript path from hook input JSON (not environment variable)
  - Uses Perl regex for robust `<promise>` tag extraction
  - Atomic iteration increment using temp file + move pattern
  - Supports unlimited iterations when max_iterations = 0
  - Better system message with promise guidance

### Changed
- **No external plugin required** - Autopilotagent is now fully self-contained
- **Installation** - `./install.sh` now installs hooks to `~/.claude/hooks/` and creates `~/.claude/hooks.json`
- **Loop state location** - Now uses `.autopilotagent/loop-state.md` (project-local) instead of `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md`

### Removed
- **Ralph Loop plugin dependency** - No longer requires `claude plugins:install claude-plugins-official`

## 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Session Analytics** - Per-session analytics files track iterations, errors, timing, and waste patterns
  - Stored in `docs/tasks/analytics/` with timestamped filenames
  - Schema defined in `analytics.schema.json`
  - Example file: `examples/analytics-user-auth-session.json`
- **Thrashing Detection** - Automatically detects when the same error repeats consecutively
  - Configurable threshold via `analytics.thrashingThreshold` (default: 3)
  - Immediately marks task as stuck when thrashing detected
  - Logs pattern to analytics for post-session analysis
- **`/autopilotagent analyze` command** - Post-session analysis of analytics files
  - Calculates efficiency score (productive vs wasted iterations)
  - Identifies waste patterns (thrashing, environment issues, missing context)
  - Generates suggested AGENTS.md entries and autopilotagent.json changes
  - Supports `--last`, `--since Nd`, `--task <name>`, `--clear` flags
- **Analytics configuration** in `autopilotagent.json`:
  - `analytics.enabled` - Toggle analytics (default: true)
  - `analytics.directory` - Where to store files (default: `docs/tasks/analytics`)
  - `analytics.thrashingThreshold` - Consecutive errors before abort (default: 3)
  - `analytics.trackToolCalls` - Track tool usage per requirement
  - `analytics.trackFileAccess` - Track files read/written per requirement

### Changed
- **TDD mode** now logs errors, iterations, and timing to analytics file
- **Stuck handling** distinguishes between thrashing (same error) and regular stuck (different approaches failed)

## 2026-01-10

### Changed
- **AGENTS.md trimmed to 63 lines** - Removed Learnings section (progress tracker), condensed TDD Pitfalls. Keeps file purely operational per Ralph Playbook recommendation.
- **Language patterns documented** - Added Language Patterns section to CLAUDE.md with proven phrasings ("study" vs "read", "capture the why", etc.)
- **Subagent parallelization guidance** - Added section to CLAUDE.md explaining when to use parallel (exploration) vs sequential (execution) subagents

### Added
- **Codebase analysis in `/tasks`** - Before generating tasks, `/tasks` now explores the codebase to understand existing patterns, utilities, and implementations
- **Gap analysis** - Each requirement is categorized as `create`, `extend`, `modify`, or `already-done` based on what code already exists
- **`codeAnalysis` field** - Requirements now include rich context: `existingFiles`, `relatedTests`, `patterns`, and `targetFiles` (modify/create)
- **`--refresh` flag for `/tasks`** - Re-analyze incomplete requirements while preserving completed ones; useful for mid-implementation course correction
- **`tasks.schema.json`** - JSON Schema for task files, enabling validation and editor autocomplete
- **Phase-numbered structure** - Both `/tasks` and `autopilotagent.md` now use explicit phase numbering (Phase 0 for pre-flight, Phase 1+ for execution)
- **Critical guardrails section** - `autopilotagent.md` now has Phase 99999+ with escalating priority guardrails:
  - 99999: Feedback loops before commits
  - 999999: Never commit on failure
  - 9999999: Search before implementing
  - 99999999: No placeholders or TODOs
  - 999999999: Single source of truth
- **Guardrails in AGENTS.md** - Added Guardrails section with search-first, no-placeholders, and single-source-of-truth rules
- **Acceptance criteria for requirements** - New `acceptance` array defines specific, testable outcomes that become test cases in TDD Red phase

### Changed
- **TDD Red phase** - Now requires tests covering ALL acceptance criteria before proceeding to Green phase
- **Code-aware TDD descriptions** - Test and implementation descriptions now reference specific files, patterns, and utilities discovered during analysis
- **Example tasks file** - `examples/tasks-user-auth.json` updated with `codeAnalysis` examples showing the new structure
- **"Don't assume not implemented" guardrail** - Built into `/tasks` Phase 1 and `autopilotagent.md` guardrails, ensuring Claude searches before implementing

### Inspiration
- Gap analysis, phase numbering, and guardrail patterns adapted from [Ralph Playbook](https://github.com/ghuntley/ralph-playbook) by Geoffrey Huntley

- **Dependency ordering** - Requirements can specify `dependsOn` for parallel execution planning
- **TDD pitfalls documentation** - AGENTS.md section on test isolation and fixture conflicts
- **CLAUDE.md** - Context file for Claude Code with project overview, architecture, and key concepts

### Changed
- **Explicit TDD enforcement** - Tests must fail before implementation, flagged as invalid if they pass early
- **Smarter code-simplifier** - Explicitly tracks files modified per requirement, passes specific file list
- **Feedback loop joining** - Commands explicitly joined with `&&` for proper error handling
- **Iteration counts** - Updated documentation explaining expected iterations per requirement
- **Notes file bootstrap** - Gracefully handles missing notes file on first run, creates with template

### Fixed
- **Argument parsing** - Fixed Ralph Loop skill args with semicolons/parentheses being interpreted as shell commands
